# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript/TypeScript

This is my personal repository where I practice solving algorithmic challenges and structuring my knowledge of data structures.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, optimize solutions, and build a well-structured collection of coding problems.

## Structure
- `problems/` â€“ Algorithmic challenges with my solutions  
- `data-structures/` â€“ Implementations of various data structures  
- `notes/` â€“ Useful notes and explanations  

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript  
- **Approach**: Step-by-step optimization, different solution techniques  

## Why this repo?
- To sharpen my algorithmic thinking  
- To prepare for coding interviews  
- To have a structured place for learning and reference  

Feel free to check out the solutions and suggest improvements! ðŸš€
