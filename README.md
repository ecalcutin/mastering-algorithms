# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript / TypeScript

This is my personal repository where I practice solving algorithmic challenges and structuring my knowledge of data structures.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, optimize solutions, and build a well-structured collection of coding problems.

## Structure

- `problems/` â€“ Algorithmic challenges with my solutions
- `structures/` â€“ Implementations of various data structures
- `notes/` â€“ Useful notes and explanations

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Approach**: Step-by-step optimization, different solution techniques

## Why this repo?

- To sharpen my algorithmic thinking
- To prepare for coding interviews
- To have a structured place for learning and reference

Feel free to check out the solutions and suggest improvements! ðŸš€
